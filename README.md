# Missing Persons Agent
Create AI models for predicting behavior and define code that do tasks related to finding missing people.
Need READ ONLY APIs that supply data for missing people and emergency alerts.
Need the best up to date APIs.

## Drupal Module
I just started work on this module as of 02-04-2026. [Sentinel](https://www.drupal.org/project/sentinel)
**Sentinel** "A soldier or guard whose job is to stand and keep watch."

## Models
Model that takes all the persons social media accounts and predics if a friend would have something to do with it based upon posts.
Model that looks for patterns in prior cases.

## Code
Define the area based upon distance able to travel in a time frame by car. Start from estimated time of found missing. Build circles starting from ground zero. Send email alerts to gas stations, markets, restaraunts, hotels, hospitals and shelters in those areas. Update to larger areas as the search progresses.

## Ideas
Create an API endpoint that can load email lists to send the alerts to them.<br/>
Send it forward email campaign. Have every person who recieve the email alert send it to all of their people they send emails to..
Modules and plugins for Wordpress, Drupal etc.. that can do all of the emailing from your website..
The module could pull from a missing persons database and list people who are reported missing in your area, city, county, state. It could also warn if a flood is comming, hurricaine, tornadoes all of it.
You then have an oportunity to send the link of the alert to your clients in an email.

Search for people who have been missing for a long time in different countries. USA, Mexico, Canada etc..

Look up all places that have public records about people to search through.

## Data APIs
FEMA Public Alert Warning System - [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system)
Missing Persons Database API - [NamUs](https://nij.ojp.gov/namus)
FEMA Github Emaple API calls - [FEMA Github](https://github.com/FEMA/openfema-samples)

## Updates
### FEMA update 02-05-2026
I signed up for the developer account at FEMA so I can use the IPAWS Api to build a page to warn people of **floods, huricaines and tornadoes** on every drupal site that uses the module. Its will also allow the admin to add alerts to emails so they can email their clients in the event of an emergency in their area. It should possibly have people check if their buildings are in a flood zone. Its going to take a couple days to get approved.

### NamUs update 02-05-2026
**I asked google AI:** Write a php script to use NamUs API to get a list of missing persons in california that have only been missing in the last week.
**I got this response:**
It is not possible to write a direct PHP script using the NamUs API as described because the
NamUs system does not have a public-facing API for automated data retrieval. While the database is publicly accessible and searchable by individuals and professionals, programmatic access through an API for fetching large, filterable datasets (such as missing persons in a specific state within a specific time frame) is not available to the general public.

**Can we open an endpoint for read only data** so I can build a module that creates pages on all Drupal sites? I want to also have it train people to be on the lookout for people who are missing by having them look at peoples images, think about the image, then print and carry a paper with the missing peoples images with them to cross reference if they are unsure. I only need name, image, brief description of what they where last wearing, hair and eye color, height etc.. Anything that would help someone identify the individual. Thanks!

### NamUs update 02-06-2026
Submitted a question asking for access to a public API for missing people.
**Response same day:** Thank you for your inquiry. Currently there is no endpoint access available for the National Missing and Unidentified Persons (NamUs) system.

### FEMA update 02-12-2026
**Response:**
Hello
I am reaching out from FEMA IPAWS Technical Support Services.
Are you interested in receiving and/or redistributing the alerts, warning and notification posted on the IPAWS All Hazards Information Feed?
Here’s more information online for potential new vendors and developers Technology Vendors & Developers | FEMA.gov
I can better assist once I understand if you are trying to be an Origination Developer and/or Redistribution Developer for IPAWS.
The Alert Origination Software Providers (AOSP vendors) are the only Developer type required to complete MOA Application in the IPAWS Users Portal.
Here’s a listing of AOSPs vendors that have successfully demonstration their IPAWS capabilities - Demonstrated IPAWS Capabilities - Alert Origination Software Providers
Let me know if you have further IPAWS questions or concerns to further assist with your needs!
Thank you

**I Resonded:**
I just want to be a  Redistribution Developer for IPAWS.I only need read access to display on a module developed for drupal called Sentinel:
https://www.drupal.org/project/sentinel

My plan is here.
https://github.com/Trigve-Hagen/missing-persons-agent/blob/main/README.md

Thanks.

### NamUs update 02-14-2026
Registered to be a user on NamUs site so I can recieve content. Will see if I can talk with the people who run the website to get an API built that allows content that is released by Law Enforcement to be available on a read only API.
If it was there now we could have the description of the Walmart backpack guy who abducted Nancy Guthrie up on every site that uses this module.
**Response same day:** They sent me an email almost immediately to register. Go to say they are awesomely prompt about stuff.

**I Registered created a Contact Us where I asked**
I would like to create an API endpoint for you. I work for the ** where I work ** as a Drupal developer. I would like to create the code block that would allow publicly viewable data via an API. If you send me the as parameters, you can make available and the type of code you need Module for Drupal, etc.. I can create the API endpoint as a module that you can install on whatever website you would use to offer up the API. My goal is to help find Nancy Guthrie and other missing people such as her. Thanks. I will build it for free.

### FEMA Update 02-16-2026
Here is what I can share about redistribution of IPAWS alerts below and in attachments. No access or application is required in the IPAWS Users Portal.
IPAWS provides all hazards alert Feeds with simple-to-implement interface for the public to consume. No key/password are required for access. Many Internet-connected devices and services use pulling method to receive IPAWS alerts. We recommend vendor set up a server to send requests no more frequently than every 2 minutes and cache results from your end. Redistribute alerts from your end to your customers.

For developer to start, please point your test server to IPAWS Staging environment which is designed for vendors testing. IPAWS provide various alert feed endpoints that match vendors need.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**EAS Feed** - This URL path returns alerts that are valid for Emergency Alert Systems (EAS) dissemination.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**NWEM Feed** - This URL path returns alerts that are valid for Non-Weather Emergency Alerts (NWEM) goes to NOAA Weather Radio dissemination.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**WEA Feed** - This URL path returns alerts that are valid for Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) dissemination.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**PUBLIC Feed (All alerts)** - This URL path returns any alert that successfully passes IPAWS authentication and validation processing regardless of dissemination path and BLOCKCHANNEL preferences. EAS, WEA, NWEM and other valid alerts can retrieve from these feeds.

STAGING (TDL) Test Environment

**Feed - Staging - EAS Feed** -  https://tdl.apps.fema.gov/IPAWSOPEN_EAS_SERVICE/rest/eas/recent/2024-02-15T12:00:00Z
**Feed - Staging - NWEM Feed** - https://tdl.apps.fema.gov/IPAWSOPEN_EAS_SERVICE/rest/nwem/recent/2024-02-15T12:00:00Z
**Feed - Staging - WEA Feed** - https://tdl.apps.fema.gov/IPAWSOPEN_EAS_SERVICE/rest/PublicWEA/recent/2024-02-15T12:00:00Z
**Feed - Staging - PUBLIC Feed** - https://tdl.apps.fema.gov/IPAWSOPEN_EAS_SERVICE/rest/public/recent/2024-02-15T12:00:00Z
**Feed - Staging - PUBLIC NON_EAS** - https://tdl.apps.fema.gov/IPAWSOPEN_EAS_SERVICE/rest/public_non_eas/recent/2024-02-15T12:00:00Z

Please see IPAWS All-Hazard Info Feed for more detail. IPAWS PMO recently change access feed policy, you can skip “Gain Access to the Feed” section.
If you don’t want traditional polling method to access IPAWS feeds, IPAWS is piloting a new message delivery method utilizing the AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS), which provides a pub/sub messing model for end users to receive IPAWS-OPEN messages. There is only one AWS SNS topic (EAS_PUBLIC_FEED) has been created at this moment. The distribution speed and content are the same as PULBIC Feed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Production:** https://apps.fema.gov/IPAWSOPEN_EAS_SERVICE/rest/public/recent/2020-08-21T11:40:43Z
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Staging:**  https://tdl.apps.fema.gov/IPAWSOPEN_EAS_SERVICE/rest/public/recent/2020-08-21T11:40:43Z

Our developers are continue developing more SNS topics for IPAWS vendors/subscribers to choose.
Similarly, for start, I would suggest your team to test pub/sub messaging method at Staging before you start pulling alert from Production with pub/sub method. IPAWS currently support following subscription methods:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email/Email-JSON
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP/HTTPS **
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AWS Lambda*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Platform application endpoint*

Note:     * Subscription methods are available but have not been fully tested.

** For using HTTP/ HTTPS endpoint, please follow AWS guide to setup and getting the ready to receive messages. AWS SNS Step 1: Make sure your endpoint is ready to process Amazon SNS messages - Amazon Simple Notification Service
Please let us know which AWS SNS subscription methods below work for you, so I will ask my developer to add that to the subscription list. I also attached IPAWS Pub/Sub quick guide to explain how IPAWS pub/sub messaging work.
All this information may seem overwhelming to you at first. Members of IPAWS Engineering Branch (fema-ipaws-eng@fema.dhs.gov)  will be happy to help and hop on a call to explain the processes in more detail.

Thank you

### Update 04-25-2026

Reading [Invisible Threads](https://blog.ry4n.org/invisible-threads-finding-missing-people-online-7dec4cb038e5).
### News Stations

- NBC News

LLM to take in news reports from news stations.
  - Look throuh news reports for people who may have been mad at you.
    - Gone to jail and got out recently.
    - Carear that may have been lost and could be looking for revenge.
    - If they lost family.
  - Get all information from reliable news outlets.
    - Look for missed information

### Social Media Accounts
  - Facebook

Build timeline for all family members and friend + in the immediate group and anyone they contacted.
  - Get any references to close friends.
  - Get all reference through bills to people she hired.
  - What services did she use?
    - Lawn Care
    - Pool Cleaners
    - Remodeling Contractors
    - Electricians
    - Sears
    - Delivery Drivers
    - Mail People
    - Phone
    - Internet and Cable.
    - etc..
  - Get list of phone calls she made.

Build out these timelines and then recursively build timelines for each person of interest found as a result of the initial investigation.
  - Look for people whos timeline ends in the close proximity of the missing person.
  - Check what they bought.
  - Who they called.
  - GPS of their phones.

### Missing Persons Favorite Things
  - Favorite Websites?
  - What where their interests?
  - Favorite Stores
    - Get a list of the clerks that worked there before the disappearence.
    - See if any went missing in the days following the disappearance.

Get a list of phone calls and emails that the person missing called and/or sent.
  - Get the identities of the people they where talking to.

Create timelines on everyone.

Time of disappearance - get what people of interest are reported doing.
  - Looking for people with records.
  - People with motives.

### Update 04-26-2026

Working on the database implementation.
 - Every time interval search for new data. Daily?
 - Have prompt ask a list of specific questions.
 - Flag recent updates of interest, save it to a database, notify user of entries.

### The Multiple Model Strategy
List all people starting with the main family and working through everyone they know. Get their purchasing history for 3  to 6 months maybe a year before the person turns up missing. Seems like a few weeks would be a good start then go furthur back on the purchase history when nothing turns up.
- Create multiple models specific to one item - softmax logits equals a probability distribution highlighting those that have a higher probability of being nefarious.
  - Renting a rent a car (more nefarious behaviour) as apposed to not; not so nefarious
  - buying gas closer to the crime scene equals (more nefarious behaviour) farther away not so nefarious
  - mobile phone GPS tracking close to the crime scene equals (more nefarious) as apposed to being far away would equal less nefarious.
  - car GPS tracking close to the crime scene equals (more nefarious) as apposed to being far away would equal less nefarious.
When you have delegated a small task to one model and you have 50 models pointing a group of people that group of people will have a higher probability of being involved.
